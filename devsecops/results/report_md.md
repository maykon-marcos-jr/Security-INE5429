## Alert Detail



### [ Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

Instances: 4

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### [ Missing Anti-clickjacking Header ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10020/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`

  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 3

### Solution

Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

### [ Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy Header Missing or Invalid ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90004/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header is a response header that prevents a document from loading any cross-origin resources that don't explicitly grant the document permission (using CORP or CORS).

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost:3000/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000/robots.txt`

  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header to 'require-corp' for documents.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-embedder-policy).

### Reference

### [ Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy Header Missing or Invalid ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90004/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header is a response header that allows a site to control if others included documents share the same browsing context. Sharing the same browsing context with untrusted documents might lead to data leak.

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost:3000/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`

  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header to 'same-origin' for documents.
'same-origin-allow-popups' is considered as less secured and should be avoided.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-opener-policy).

### [ Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy Header Missing or Invalid ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90004/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header is an opt-in header designed to counter side-channels attacks like Spectre. Resource should be specifically set as shareable amongst different origins.

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`
  * Attack: ``

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header to 'same-origin' for all web pages.
'same-site' is considered as less secured and should be avoided.
If resources must be shared, set the header to 'cross-origin'.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-resource-policy).

### [ Permissions Policy Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10063/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.

### [ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`

  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`

Instances: Systemic


### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

### [ Storable and Cacheable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where "shared" caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.

### Solution

Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information. If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
This configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) from the cache, in response to a similar request.
